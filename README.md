Twilio knockoff of Twitch Plays Pokemon with 2048

Big thanks to [@grant](https://github.com/grant)'s [HN Plays 2048](https://github.com/grant/hnplays2048) and most of all, [@gabrielecirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli)'s [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048). These two open-source projects are the building blocks of Twilio Plays 2048, and it wouldn't have been pulled off within a hackathon without them.
