Twilio knockoff of Twitch Plays Pokemon with 2048

Big thanks to [@grant](https://github.com/grant)'s [HN Plays 2048](https://github.com/grant/hnplays2048) and obviously, [@gabrielecirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli)'s [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048). These two projects are the foundation of Twilio Plays 2048, and we wouldn't have been able to win Best Use of [@twilio](https://github.com/twilio) at [Hack the North](http://hackthenorth.com) without them.
